# COVID-PNEUMONIA-DETECTION-USING-XRAY
A DL model used to detect the covid, pneumonia, normal lungs using cnn model
This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow to classify and predict various lung conditions, including COVID-19, pneumonia, normal lung conditions, and lung opacity, based on X-ray images. The model aims to assist in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory conditions by analyzing chest X-rays, which are commonly used in medical imaging to detect lung abnormalities.
The Dataset I used for the model is: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/covid19-radiography-dataset".

The CNN architecture will be designed to effectively capture features from the X-ray images, allowing for high accuracy in distinguishing between different types of lung conditions. The project will involve preprocessing the X-ray images, building and training the CNN model, and evaluating its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The end goal is to provide a tool that can be integrated into healthcare systems to support clinicians in making faster and more reliable diagnoses, particularly in resource-constrained environments where access to radiologists may be limited.
